# New-York-PC-Repair-Example
This is an example for Aliquid. 
The point of this website is to give clients an example portfolio.

Basically, the site is very simple with a few slight changes here and there from our normal template. 

This site does NOT at the moment carry a working contact form. Will be deleting as much SCSS (maybe).


Features:

1. Mobile Responsive
2. Drop-down on navbar
3. Bootstrap 4 with Font Awesome (framework/library)
4. Basically 98% HTML and CSS
5. Everything needed for a simple website.
